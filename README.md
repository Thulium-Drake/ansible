This repository contains some playbooks and roles I wrote for Ansible in various places.

# Roles:
The roles have moved to their own repo's, as that's way easier for publishing them to Ansible Galaxy

Check them out at https://galaxy.ansible.com/thulium_drake

# Example setups and other stuff
* [vmware-example-setup](vmware-example-setup/): Ansible environment for use with VMWare, for use a guide to setup.
* [molecule-setup](molecule-setup/): Ansible environment to setup Molecule on a system

Have fun!
