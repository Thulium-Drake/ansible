This repository contains some playbooks and roles I wrote for Ansible in various places.

# Roles:
* [adjoin](roles/adjoin/): Role to join Linux machines to an Active Directory Domain
* [vmware](roles/vmware/): Role to manage aspects of VMWare guests

# Example setups and other stuff
* [vmware-example-setup](vmware-example-setup/): Ansible environment for use with VMWare, for use a guide to setup.

Have fun!
