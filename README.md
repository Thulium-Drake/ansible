This repository contains some playbooks and roles I wrote for Ansible in various places.

* [vmware](vmware/): Role to manage aspects of VMWare guests
* [vmware-example-setup](vmware-example-setup/): Ansible environment for use with VMWare, for use a guide to setup.
* [adjoin](adjoin/): Role to join Linux machines to an Active Directory Domain

Have fun!
